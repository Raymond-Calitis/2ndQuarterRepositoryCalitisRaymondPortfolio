        <h2>
            What is Clash Royale?</h2>
        <p> Clash Royale is a multiplayer mobile game made by supercell where you collect cards and battle other players in real-time. Each player has a deck of 8 cards featuring different troops, spells, and buildings. The goal is to destroy your opponent's towers while defending your own. Matches are short and exciting, usually lasting just three minutes. <br> <br>

            The game is easy to learn but hard to master. You place your cards on the battlefield by spending "elixir" - a resource that slowly fills up during the match. You need to think quickly about when to attack and when to defend. Different cards work well together, so building a good deck is important. There are common, rare, epic, legendary, champion cards to collect and upgrade. <br> <br>

            As you win battles, you earn trophies and climb higher in arenas. You can join a clan with friends to share cards and practice together. Clash Royale mixes strategy, quick thinking, and collection in one entertaining package that keeps players coming back for "just one more battle". <br> <br> </p>
